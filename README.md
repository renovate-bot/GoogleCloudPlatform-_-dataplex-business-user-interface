# Dataplex Universal Catalog Business Interface - 1.2.1

An open-source, web-based application called **`Dataplex Business Interface`** which aims to help business users of BigQuery customers discover and access data assets in the **Dataplex** Universal Catalog (formerly Data Catalog).
## Key objectives of the application include:
- Empowering business users to find relevant data independently.
- Streamlining the data access request process using **Dataplex's** API.
**Improving** data governance and compliance with an audit trail for access requests.
Increasing data literacy by making data more discoverable.
Providing a customizable platform for future data governance enhancements.
## The target user personas are:
Business users and others who need to access and understand data in **Dataplex**.
Data Stewards.

## Key Features
### Secure Google Sign-In: 
Integration with @react-oauth/google for a smooth and secure login experience.
### Protected Routes: 
Utilizes react-router-dom to protect specific routes, redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page.
### Modern Tech Stack: 
Built with Vite for a fast development experience, TypeScript for type safety, and Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
### Mock Backend Simulation: 
Includes a simulated API to demonstrate the frontend's interaction with a backend for exchanging the authorization code, allowing the frontend to be run standalone for development.
### **GCP APIs** Permission Check: 
After successful authentication, the application will use **GCP APIs** to check if the logged-in user has **Dataplex** permissions. This check will ensure that only authorized users can access **Dataplex** data.
### Search with Filters: 
The UI will allow users to search for **Dataplex** datasets using various filters. The search functionality will leverage **Dataplex** APIs to query the data.
### Catalogs Retrieval: 
The application will retrieve and display **Dataplex** catalogs. Users will be able to browse through the catalogs to find datasets.
### Dataset Details: 
When a user selects a dataset, the application will fetch and display details such as Asset name, description, Project ID, and metadata using the **Dataplex** API.

## Libraries & Tools
**React**: The core UI library.

**TypeScript**: For static typing and improved code quality.

**Vite**: A next-generation frontend tooling for fast development builds.

**@react-oauth/google**: The primary library for handling the Google OAuth flow on the client side.

**React Router**: For client-side routing and managing protected routes.

**Material UI**: For modern, responsive, utility-first styling.

## Getting Started: Running Locally
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
Node.js (v20 or later)

An active Google Cloud account

#### Step 1: Clone & Install Dependencies
Clone the repository and install the necessary npm packages.

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/dataplex-business-user-interface
cd dataplex-business-user-interface
npm install
```

#### Step 2: Configure Google OAuth Client ID
Go to the **Google Cloud Console**.

Create a new project or select an existing one.

Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials.

Click + CREATE CREDENTIALS and select OAuth client ID.

Choose **Web application** as the application type.

Under Authorized JavaScript origins, add http://localhost:5173.

Under Authorized redirect URIs, add http://localhost:5173.

Click CREATE and copy the generated **Client ID and Secret**.

#### Step 3: Update Client ID in the Project
Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder with your actual Client ID:
```shell
// .env
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com'; // <-- PASTE YOUR ID HERE
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
```
#### Step 4: Run the Application
Start the Vite development server.

npm run dev

Open your browser to http://localhost:5173 to see the application running.

Deployment Guide: **Google Cloud Run**
This guide covers deploying the static frontend to **Google Cloud Run**.

**Note: This deploys the frontend only, which relies on the mockApi. For a full production application, you must also deploy a secure backend to handle the token exchange logic.**

For backend deployment in local you should check the readme file in backend folder
and set the VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:8080/api" in the .env file for frontend
if you are running your backend on other port make sure to set the api url accordingly 

## Cloud Run Deployment Steps for production

### Prerequisites
You should have access to **GCP Cloud Shell** or **Google Cloud SDK (gcloud)** installed and authenticated.
A GCP project with billing enabled.
You should have access to cloud run, and api enable permissions in the project.
Assumption that dataplex api and BigQuery API is enabled and you have sufficient permissions

Create a OAuth client using google auth platform as it is used for authentication
Visit here https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/clients
The steps are already mentioned above as **step 2 in Running locally**
In this step you would get client id and secret save it some where secure 

#### Step 1: Auth to Cloud shell or Google Cloud SDK
Login with the account in which you have access of the project for deployment
```shell
gcloud auth login
```
#### Step 2: Set the project in which you are going to deploy this application
Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID with the actual Project id in the below command before running it 
```shell
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

#### Step 3: Enable Cloud run and artifact API's for deployment
```shell
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com artifactregistry.googleapis.com cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
```

#### Step 4: Clone the repo into you Cloud shell or in case of Google cloud SDK clone it into the installed computer 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/dataplex-business-user-interface
```
After cloning go inside the cloned repo
```shell
cd dataplex-business-user-interface
```

now before building the container if we want to do any default configs setting for ui change we can do that
via changing the **configData.json** inside the backend folder 

### This is manadotory if you want to use **Browse by aspects** functionality in the UI, if you don't want to use **Browse by aspects** functionality you can skip this and move on to Step 5 of deployment steps .

```shell
vi backend/configData.json // or use any code/text editor
```
Once you open this file you will see the json structure as mentioned below.

```json
{
  "aspectType": {},
  "assets": {},
  "products": []
}
```

Now to use browse by aspects we have to set the aspectType here in the below format.

```json
{
  "aspectType": {
    // this is the format to put full name as the key and fields of aspects as value
    "projects/{replace-project-number}/locations/{replace-location-here}/entryGroups/@dataplex/entries/{replace-aspect-id-here}_aspectType":[
      //the below fields are just samples, please use the fields name which exists in your aspect you have mentioned in the name
      "sales",
      "hr",
    ],
    "projects/{replace-project-number}/locations/{replace-location-here}/entryGroups/@dataplex/entries/{replace-aspect-id-here}_aspectType":[
      //the below fields are just samples, please use the fields name which exists in your aspect you have mentioned in the name
      "marketing",
      "domainname",
    ],

  },
  "assets": {},
  "products": []
}
```

To populate the aspects name you need project-number, location of the apsects, and aspect type id
Folllow these steps to get the values for configuration:
1. Open the **GCP Console**
2. Open the sidebar **cloud overview** and the select **Dashboard**.
3. Here you can see the project number.
4. Copy the project number and replace it in the name.
  `projects/1069*****1809/locations/{replace-location-here}/entryGroups/@dataplex/entries/{replace-aspect-id-here}_aspectType`
5. Now go to **Dataplex Universal Catalog**.
6. Search for the name of the aspect and open the detail view.
7. In here you can find the aspect type id, location and we already have the project number from the previous steps using that our name would be.
  `projects/1069*****1809/locations/us-central1/entryGroups/@dataplex/entries/aspecttype3_aspectType`.
8. Now to get the field values we can see in the same details screen we have the fields mentioned.
9. Copy the names create the string array with the name and use all small cases in here.
10. Now the json file would look like this.
```json
{
  "aspectType": {
    "projects/1069*****1809/locations/us-central1/entryGroups/@dataplex/entries/aspecttype3_aspectType":[
      "sales",
      "finance",
      "marketing",
    ],
    //you can add more aspects here 
  },
  "assets": {},
  "products": []
}
```
11. You can add as many aspects you want in the same manner.
12. And save this in configData.json under backend folder.


**Now you are done with the aspects configuration for browse by funationality**

#### Step 5: Create the artifact repository to store the container artifact, this command require to run only once for the deployment if you are redeplying skip this step
Replace `[REPO_NAME]` with the name you want to give like (dataplex-business-ui-artifact, etc.) and set up your preferred region by setting that in --location flag below command is using `us-central1` but you can replace it but make sure if you replace it then use the same region in below steps by replacing `us-central1` with the the used value.
```shell
gcloud artifacts repositories create `[REPO_NAME]` --repository-format=docker --location=us-central1 --description="Docker repository for dataplex-business-ui project"
```

#### Step 6 Build the Docker Image with Cloud Build
Submit your project to **Google Cloud Build** to create a container image. Replace `[PROJECT_ID]`with your GCP Project ID,
`[REPO_NAME]` which you created in step 5 and `[APP_NAME]`with your desired application name.

```shell
gcloud builds submit . --tag us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/[PROJECT_ID]/[REPO_NAME]/[APP_NAME]:latest
```

#### Step 7: Deploy to Cloud Run
Replace the [PROJECT_ID],[REPO_NAME],[APP_NAME] with the value you have used above and replace [SERVICE_NAME] with the name you want to set your cloud run service, [ADMIN_EMAIL_ID] to your admin email you want to set, then the most important replace the [CLIENT_ID] and [CLIENT_SCERET] with the **OAuth credentials** you created in earlier steps.

Deploy the container image you just built to **Cloud Run** using the below command after replacing the mentioned values.
After successful deployment it will return a url to access the application.

```shell
gcloud run deploy [SERVICE_NAME] \
  --image us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/[PROJECT_ID]/[REPO_NAME]/[APP_NAME]:latest \
  --platform managed \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --port 8080 \
  --set-env-vars  VITE_API_URL="/api" \
  --set-env-vars  VITE_API_VERSION="v1" \
  --set-env-vars  VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL="[ADMIN_EMAIL_ID]" \
  --set-env-vars  VITE_GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID="[PROJECT_ID]" \
  --set-env-vars  VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="[CLIENT_ID]" \
  --set-env-vars  VITE_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI="/auth/google/callback" \
  --set-env-vars  GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID="[PROJECT_ID]" \
  --set-env-vars  GCP_LOCATION="global" \
  --set-env-vars  GCP_REGION="global" \
  --set-env-vars  VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="[CLIENT_SCERET]"
```
**--platform managed**: Specifies the fully managed Cloud Run environment.

**--region**: Choose a region that is close to you.

**--allow-unauthenticated**: Makes the frontend publicly accessible.

Cloud Run will provide you with a public URL for your service.

#### Step 8: Update OAuth Credentials for Production
Go back to your **Google Cloud Console** > Credentials page.

Edit your Web application client ID.

Add the URL provided by **Cloud Run** (e.g., https://your-app-name-....run.app) to the Authorized JavaScript origins and Authorized redirect URIs.

Save your changes.

**Your application is now deployed and accessible, with both front-end and backend in one single container and cloud run service!**
 
### For redeployment follow the steps below 

#### Step 1: Pull the latest changes from the code repository
if you want to redeploy the changes with the latest codes.
Go to the repository folder inside the cloud shell and run the command below.

```shell
git pull
```

#### Step 2: Modify the backend/configData.json if required
if you want any changes in your backend/configData.json for the browse experience, you can do so or if you don't want the changes in that use the same file. 
for modification of the configData.json file run the command below.
```shell
vi backend/configData.json
```

#### Step 3: we have to re build the Docker Image with Cloud Build
Submit your project to **Google Cloud Build** to create a container image. Replace `[PROJECT_ID]`with your GCP Project ID,
`[REPO_NAME]` which you created in step 5 and `[APP_NAME]`with your desired application name.

```shell
gcloud builds submit . --tag us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/[PROJECT_ID]/[REPO_NAME]/[APP_NAME]:latest
```

#### Step 4: Deploy to Cloud Run
Replace the [PROJECT_ID],[REPO_NAME],[APP_NAME] with the value you have used above and replace [SERVICE_NAME] with the name you want to set your cloud run service, [ADMIN_EMAIL_ID] to your admin email you want to set, then the most important replace the [CLIENT_ID] and [CLIENT_SCERET] with the **OAuth credentials** you created in earlier steps.

Deploy the container image you just built to Cloud Run using the below command after replacing the mentioned values.
After successful deployment it will return a url to access the application.

```shell
gcloud run deploy [SERVICE_NAME] \
  --image us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/[PROJECT_ID]/[REPO_NAME]/[APP_NAME]:latest \
  --platform managed \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --port 8080 \
  --set-env-vars  VITE_API_URL="/api" \
  --set-env-vars  VITE_API_VERSION="v1" \
  --set-env-vars  VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL="[ADMIN_EMAIL_ID]" \
  --set-env-vars  VITE_GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID="[PROJECT_ID]" \
  --set-env-vars  VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="[CLIENT_ID]" \
  --set-env-vars  VITE_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI="/auth/google/callback" \
  --set-env-vars  GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID="[PROJECT_ID]" \
  --set-env-vars  GCP_LOCATION="global" \
  --set-env-vars  GCP_REGION="global" \
  --set-env-vars  VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="[CLIENT_SCERET]"
```

**Your application is now redeployed and accessible, with both front-end and backend in one single container and cloud run service!**
